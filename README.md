# IrAnalyzer
This pio-project will analyze all incoming infrared-signals and will display the values and the used protocols.

It uses the ESP8266 with an IR-Receiver connected to **D5**.\
Set the baud rate of the serial-monitor to 115200.

The output will look like:
* Recieved: 1000C - with Protocol: RC6
* Recieved: 4BB620DF - with Protocol: NEC
* Recieved: F720DF - with Protocol: NEC
* Recieved: F7A05F - with Protocol: NEC
* Recieved: F7609F - with Protocol: NEC
* Recieved: 10076 - with Protocol: RC6
